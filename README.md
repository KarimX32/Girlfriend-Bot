# Girlfriend Bot
This repo is basically the source code for the main youtube video which was basically me creating a girlfriend that i can talk to in VC and her replying to me. Don't worry i'm not down bad, it was just suggested by some members, so i'm fine.

YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyWYb83uYwE&ab_channel=UltraX

## Guide
Follow these steps to be able to start the bot properly.

### Step 1:
You're gonna star this repo and click on the green download button and download the code (ZIP)

### Step 2: 
Once that's done, you're going to open the folder in your IDE and do `npm install`, Note that you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

### Step 3: 
You're gonna create a new file and name it `.env` and put the following code
```env
TOKEN=
X=
```
- Next to the token, you will grab your bot's token that can be obtained from the [discord developers portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Next to `X` you're going to grab an api key from [UltraX API](https://ultrax-yt.com) and put it there
- P.S. The website (UltraX) isn't designed for phone usage.

### Step 4
Now you can enjoy your bot by starting it, type `node .` in the terminal to run the bot

### Note:
The bot will require a while to be able to work in vc, so maybe let it be online for 1 minute, then add it to the vc using `!callMyGF` and wait for 10 seconds or so. If you faced any issues you can always join our [discord server](https://ultrax-yt.com/discord)!
